Utilizing code provided from William Schreuder via the ex9, ex13, ex15, ex17, and ex25 programs

Approximate time: (TBD) hours

What's left:
  Still needs a bit of work, but we're on schedule.  The Vader fighter needs normals finished up and textures added to the wings (Will stick with colors only for the body).  We are having some minor issues with camera clipping when zooming in on the fighters (the trench is being cut off), but should be able to figure that out.  We need to add rotation and and dynamic laser-firing to the turrets, add the rest of the body of the death star, and implement our movement scheme for the fighters through the trench.  Lighting needs some work (no rotation, fixed, with emission from the fighters/lasers and specular to imitate sunlight of some sort).  From there, the scene just needs minor adjustments to sharpen edges and add details to our models.  We are relying solely on our modeling skills for the models; we will not be using any type of OBJ file.  Please provide any and all feedback that you deem necessary!  Some tips on preventing the trench from being clipped would help too, although I think it's being caused by our FOV settings.  Will continue to work to make our deadline in a week.  We'll make it!
