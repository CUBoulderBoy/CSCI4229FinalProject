Final Project: Death Star Chase scene from Star Wars IV: A New Hope

Jeremy Granger and Christopher Jordan
CSCI4229 Fall 2014

Utilizing code provided from William Schreuder via the ex9, ex13, ex15, ex17, and ex25 programs

Approximate time: ~110 man-hours

Workload Breakdown:
  Jeremy (50 hrs):
    - Skybox - full build
    - Trench and scaffolding - full build
    - Vader Tie Fighter model
    - Lasers
    - Animations (final)

  Christopher (60 hrs):
    - Turret - full build
    - X-Wing fighter - full build
    - Tie Fighter (!vader) - full build
    - Normals & texture application of Vader's fighter
    - X-Wing initial animation

  *** In this context, full build means that the person constructed the geometry, fixed the normals, and applied textures.

Look out for:
  Detail of the models, looping of the lasers and trench animation, proper application of textures, overall design and feel of scene.

  Also note: on camera 3, we decided to leave out the cockpit overlay due to the time constraints and difficulty of adding it to the scene properly.  The issue was that we couldn't figure out how to make the octagonal windows transparent (in order to see through) while the rest of the cockpit remained visible.  

Building: "make"
Running: "./final"
Cleaning up: "make clean"
Chaining: "make clean && make && ./final && make clean"
